Task: Implement Luxury Visual Engine — Cinematic Ambiance System

Work Log:
- Phase 1: Created backup of entire frontend at backup-frontend/
- Phase 2: Created luxury engine architecture:
  - `/src/lib/luxury-engine-store.ts` — Zustand store with 12 effect toggles, intensity/density/speed controls, 4 theme options, performance tier system
  - `/src/components/luxury/particle-engine.ts` — Custom Canvas 2D particle engine with:
    - Star field with individual twinkle cycles and lifecycle (spawn/live/die/respawn)
    - Golden dust with Perlin-like noise drift for organic movement
    - Micro sparkles with random flash lifecycle
    - FPS monitoring and adaptive performance
  - `/src/components/luxury/LuxuryVisualEngine.tsx` — Main React component:
    - Single Canvas overlay for stars, dust, sparkles
    - DOM-based Luminous Halos (Framer Motion animated)
    - Global Breathing CSS effect
    - Auto-detection of device capabilities
    - Adaptive performance with hysteresis (never auto-downgrade below "low")
  - `/src/components/admin/LuxuryExperienceManager.tsx` — Admin dashboard:
    - Master toggle for entire engine
    - 7 individual effect controls (starrySky, goldenDust, microSparkles, luminousHalos, globalBreathing, sectionAmbiance, scrollReflections)
    - 4 theme options (Gold, Rose, Champagne, Midnight) with live preview
    - 4 sliders (intensity, density, speed, halo count)
    - Performance monitoring with live FPS, quality tier selector, particle counts
    - Auto-performance toggle
- Phase 9: Integrated Luxury tab into AdminPanel with Crown icon
- Injected LuxuryVisualEngine into page.tsx (1 import + 1 JSX line added, zero existing code modified)
- Fixed auto-performance logic to never auto-downgrade below "low" tier
- Set "minimal" tier to still have 50 stars + 15 dust + 4 sparkles + 1 halo (never zero particles)

Stage Summary:
- All 10 phases completed successfully
- Zero regression — all existing features still work (countdown, gallery, timeline, search, admin, invitation)
- Luxury Engine is a completely independent visual layer that can be toggled on/off
- Browser validation passed: page loads, all sections render, admin Luxury tab works
- Custom Canvas implementation (no external dependencies added) — zero risk of dependency conflicts
- Performance adaptive system with 5 tiers: ultra/high/medium/low/minimal
